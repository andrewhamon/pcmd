# This is a script that runs a freshly compiled version of pcmd. This is useful
# in dev so that it isn't necessary to remember to recompile before running, and
# can be used in ssh config easily. Because Make only builds when dependencies
# are newer than the binary, this script usually adds no preceptible delay.

# Always set working dir to the pcmd project root, where the logs and lockfiles
# will be gitignored.
