# setup and teardown. You might imagine the setup is provisioning a new host to
# ssh to, and the teardown might be snapshotting the host before terminating it.
# Note that all logs are sent to stderr -- this is important because SSH will
# expect stdin and stdout to be a TCP stream to an SSH server.
